# 👾 Van Potent | Distributed Systems Enthusiast & Advocate for Freedom

🌍 **Location**: Algeria  
🧠 **Focus Areas**: HPC, DLT, and Quantum Algorithms  

## 🛠 Tools & Languages:
- Rust, Clojure, Haskell  
- GraphQL, gRPC, Protobuf  
- Kubernetes, Docker Swarm  
- Kafka, Cassandra, ZeroMQ  
- CUDA, OpenCL for GPU acceleration  
- TensorFlow, JAX  

## 💡 What I'm Working On:
Currently building a decentralized consensus protocol that operates under Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) constraints, optimizing leader election using Raft, Paxos, and a sprinkle of hybrid logical clocks (HLC).  

## 🔬 Research Interests:
- Lambda Calculus and Functional Reactive Programming  
- Quantum circuit simulation and optimization algorithms for NISQ devices  
- Scaling microservices architectures using Istio for service mesh optimization  
- Asynchronous data pipelines and low-latency messaging systems  

## 🎓 Background:
With a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science, my work focuses on designing and scaling fault-tolerant systems and experimenting with novel quantum algorithms to explore potential breakthroughs in cryptography and machine learning.

## 💬 Advocacy:
Living in a country with limited freedoms has only strengthened my belief in the power of open-source software, decentralized systems, and individual privacy. I support technologies that empower individuals to communicate and collaborate freely, regardless of restrictions imposed by authoritarian regimes.  

## 🌱 Always Learning:
Currently diving deeper into Homomorphic Encryption and Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) for privacy-preserving decentralized applications.  

## 🛰 My Vision:
I'm on a mission to push the boundaries of what's possible in distributed systems and quantum computing. Let's build the future of decentralized computation, a future where information flows freely, and every individual can harness the power of technology without fear.
